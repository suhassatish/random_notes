SN: Time to closure of funding rounds taking longer in corona times. No one is asking where is the startup based.
Pune vs Palo Alto doesnt matter.

HK: Bar on story telling is much higher for a founder in the digital world.

SN: Didnt have co-investments in tech & consumer goods jointly before. Its changing now.

HK: Covid is a tail wind for digital adoption.

Evolution of Cross-Border Investing

Kiran Mysore - Principal, UTEC, Japan
Arpit Beri - VP, Jungle Ventures
Anvita Dekhane - Venture Fellow, Pear VC, USA

6-10 YEARS EXIT HORIZON EXPECTATION OF VCs.

AB:
Gone are days of investor bringing in $100K for 20% of stake in company for VC. Short changing of founders has literally
disappeared. Everyone's talking about writing $1M checks now at seed-stage. Domestic investors are no longer super
conservative. Local investor ecosystem has matured a lot in the last 10 years.

Cant say foreign capital is more patient for returns or vice versa.

Earlier, founders would say - This model has worked in US, China, it'll  work in India. Now, they come with 10 yrs
domain expertise in FMCG, and say I've seen these pay points 1st hand and no one is addressing it. This is more
powerful.

KM: Lab to market phase. Product dev and customer dev going hand in hand is the way to go. Talk early to customers &
get early feedback. Fastest, least expensive way to get to market. His VC firm emphasizes on research-based founder
transitioning to CEO.

Also look at $200M-$500M IPOs, not just $2B-$5B exits.

Raising funds from public markets is getting easier for deep tech.

Why is selling a more popular exit for Indian startups than IPOs? Regulatory requirements for listing was 2 years of
profitability. Wasn't easy. But regulations changing now. Can list overseas. Emergence of SPAC (?) as a mechanism.
Will be major exit path going fwd. Zomato is claiming going IPO on BSE. Listed company acquiring someone makes the
smaller company that's acquired, also more valuable.
